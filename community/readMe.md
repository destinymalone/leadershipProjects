### Responsibilities
This team will be responsible for coordinating the efforts for Base Camp students to lead weekly computer coding courses at Davidson Elementary in Water Valley. The after-school club will meet Mondays from 2:45 to 4:30 starting September 9th. This team will be responsible for designing the curriculum and ensuring it is effectively delivered to the students. Base Camp students will rotate turns so that the entire class teaches the lessons with the number of times each student teaches distributed across the class.

### Requirements
1. Creation and documentation of curriculum and lesson plans
2. Distribution of teaching responsibilities to class
3. Communicating with the school to coordinate lessons
4. Easily accessible schedule of courses and topics

### Context
The after school club started in January of 2019, and Base Camp students taught every Monday from January to April. The Base Camp students taught in groups of three and four, and one student from the group would teach again the following week to keep consistency. There are not computers at the facility, so Base Camp students will bring their laptops to work with the students. Last year's topics covered fairly simple front-end web topics, and the elementary students made simple web games.
